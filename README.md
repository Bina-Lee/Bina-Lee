# 👋 Hi, I'm Jinseong Lee

I'm currently an **Integrated B.E./M.S. student** in the **Department of Embedded System Engineering** at **Incheon National University**.  
My academic and research interests include:

- Embedded Tiny Vision  
- Vision Processing Algorithm  
- Firmware and System-level Design  
- Comprehensive Design of Embedded Systems

Since 2022, I’ve been conducting research as an **Undergraduate Researcher** at the **Wireless Communication LAB**, where I focus on the intersection of embedded systems and intelligent sensing technologies.
